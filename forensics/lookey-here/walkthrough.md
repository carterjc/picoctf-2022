This one is very easy. If you're on a unix based system, you can simply run the command `grep "picoCTF{" anthem.flag.txt`. Alternatively, and maybe more preferable on Windows, you can simply open the file and CTRL-F for the same string, "picoCTF{".

The flag is: `picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4554f5f5}`.
