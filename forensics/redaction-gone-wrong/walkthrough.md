# Redaction gone wrong

As the title suggests, the redaction has gone wrong. Redaction is the process of hiding/removing data from something, typically in the context of official documents. Opening the document reveals the presence of many black bars seemingly covering text. As the redaction has "gone wrong", I am curious as to whether they really are removing the text.

This challenge is a .pdf classic. Simply CTRL-A, CTRL-C, and CTRL-V in another document. This will show all the text, even if covered by the black bars.

Analyzing the pasted text reveals the flag: `picoCTF{C4n_Y0u_S33_m3_fully}`.
