# substitution2

I'll keep it short, so using [Dcode's substitution calculator](https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution) again works perfectly. Like copy paste and decode. That's it. Sigh.

The intended solution likely related to ngram analysis based on the flag and the hint. Anyway, the flag ends up being `picoCTF{N6R4M_4N41Y515_15_73D10U5_6CDAEA76}`.
