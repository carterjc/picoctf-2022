# rail-fence

Draw it out on paper, yeah right - we'll just use CyberChef. Upload `message.txt` to CyberChef and select the Rail Fence recipe. There are key and offset parameters that can be modified. We can iterate over possible key values, finding that readable text can be discerned when the key = 4. The following string is printed: `The flag is: WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_EB4C7D74`.

The flag solution is thus as follows: `picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_EB4C7D74}`
