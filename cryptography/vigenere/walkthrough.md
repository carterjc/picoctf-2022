# vigenere

This was one of the last easy cryptography problems and by god is it easy--a clasic vigenere cipher problem. I just used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), uploaded the `cipher.txt` file, added the Vigenere Decode recipe with the key stated in the instructions: CYLAB. And... there's the flag... already: `picoCTF{D0NT_US3_V1G3N3R3_C1PH3R_y23c13p5}`.
